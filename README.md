# LNG Market Analysis ML Model

## Introduction
This project develops a machine learning model to analyze and predict trends in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market. By harnessing the predictive power of neural networks and sentiment analysis, this model aims to provide actionable insights into LNG pricing, demand, and optimal routing for trading strategies.

## Background
**LNG**: A critical component of the global energy market, LNG includes primarily **methane** and **ethane**. Its trade is influenced by various factors, including economic indicators, market sentiment, and geopolitical events.

**Liquefied Petroleum Gas**

**Arbitrage Routing**


## Model Description
### Neural Network
#### Baseline Model
The baseline neural network model is designed to predict LNG prices based on historical data. It will serve as a comparison point for more complex models.

### LLM for Sentiment Analysis 

#### OpenAI Fine Tuning (Baseline) 
The baseline model incorporates sentiment analysis using OpenAI's fine-tuning capabilities to interpret market sentiment from news sources and social media.

#### Local LLAMA 2 Model with Fine Tuning
An advanced version, Local LLAMA 2, fine-tunes the sentiment analysis specifically for LNG market nuances, aiming for greater accuracy in sentiment prediction.
